# Welcome to the City of Traitors

Welcome to the newly reimagined **City of Traitors** website. This site is dedicated to the history and strategy of Magic: The Gathering, with a special focus on Legacy and Vintage formats where the [City of Traitors](https://scryfall.com/card/exo/143/city-of-traitors) land card shines.

## What to Expect

In the coming weeks, I will be posting:

- **Deck Techs**: Deep dives into decks that utilize fast mana.
- **Tournament Reports**: Chronicles of my battles in local and major events.
- **Card Spotlights**: Analysis of specific cards and their place in history.

Stay tuned for more content!
